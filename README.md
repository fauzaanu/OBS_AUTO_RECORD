# OBS AUTO RECORD
Script to start OBS Recording when a certain program is running. And to exit when that program exits. Hardcoded for illustrator.

Script is meant to be running continousely from system startup

## Important
- Record in mkv (still might corrupt)
- setup shortcuts to stop recording 

## TODO
- [ ]  ~~Add pyautogui and send the hotkey~~ : HOTKEYS NOT WORKING
- [x] Change structure to add more programs instead of 1
